I'm Hamzah, a 16 y.o. student of Pakistani origin. I'm interested in efficient AI/ML solutions, mainly those in C++. You might recognize me by my alias "XeTute" which I previously used online on all platforms, and still do for my webapge and production services to make them feel more professional.
To get better at what I do, I program / script my own services which I'd use myself.
