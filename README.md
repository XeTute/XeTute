<h1><strong>Hello, Friend.</strong></h1><br>
<p>We're XeTute Technologies, a company dedicated to make efficient software using C++ and some ASMx64_86.</p><br>
We're working on (open-source):<br>
- A HTML & CSS framework which will allow for dynamic element rendering using C++.<br>
- ANNA(Asadullah's Neural Network Architecture)â€”A neural network architecture framework for our architecture designed for roleplaying, storytelling, and other tasks where Transformers are too heavy for little quality gain.<br>
We're <strong>academically focused</strong> and use as much knowledge we have to ensure that our applications are written in an efficient manner.<br>
This means:<br>
- Our Open-Source code will provide you with already well optimized libraries for your projects.<br>
- We do not adapt trends in the coding world if do not see any performance and or security wise improvement.<br>
We stay commited to our goals.
