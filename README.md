**Hello, Friend.**
We're XeTute, a company dedicated to make efficient software using C++ and some ASMx64_86.
We're working on:
- Flare - an AI chatapp, powered by our Recurrent Neural Network, built from scratch in C++ and CUDA.
- An self-hosted database for the app above - we'll open-source that!
- A HTML & CSS framework which will allow for dynamic element rendering using C++ trough server-side processing.
We're **academically focused** and use as much knowledge we have to ensure that our applications are written in an efficient manner.
This means:
- Our Open-Source code will provide you with already well optimized libraries for your projects.
- We do not adapt trends in the coding world if do not see any performance and or security wise improvement.
We stay commited to our goals.
