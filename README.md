# Hello, Friend | ہیلو، دوست | 朋友你好

"I'm" XeTute Technologies, an Pakistani individual who goes through the alias "XeTute". I hope to contribute for making technology, especially ML-concepts and efficient computing, accessible in the African and Asian continent.  
Still studying, might not be able to provide as much professionalism as actual companies, but I'm passionate about what I do so I should be fine.
