I'm Hamzah, a 16 y.o. student of Pakistani origin. I'm interested in efficient AI/ML solutions, mainly those in C++. You might recognize me by my alias "XeTute" which I previously used online on all platforms, and still do for my webapge and production services to make them feel more professional.
To get better at what I do, I program / script services which I'd use myself.

Pakistan is a country in South-Asia known for it's rich culture despite the British, its stunning landscape and PAF (Pakistan Armed Forces), its military.  
Long live the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
